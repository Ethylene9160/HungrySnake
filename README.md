# HungrySnake
This is an classical game - gluttonous snake, but I don't really make a good one, so I'd like to call it "Hungry Snake". This is the first time using '.c' for me, which might be used in STM32 for fun...

However, there exists some synatic errors which abay C99 standard. Accessing mmid-term exam to fix it.
